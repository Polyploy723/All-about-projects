# All-about-projects
Here is my first original project idea for my 1st year financial engineering final named "Suit the suits" 
which intended to have 2 levels of a memory game, partly inspired by the "Gofish" card game. I have worked on this for a few months
but ended up cannot fix file import problems and bugs. 
Please feel free to look over my attempted.
